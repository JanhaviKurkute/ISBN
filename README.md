The goal of this project is to create a Python application that performs ISBN validation and retrieves book information using web scraping techniques. The application should validate both 10-digit and 13-digit ISBNs, checking their integrity according to the established rules. Additionally, it should utilize web scraping to extract relevant book information from an online source, enhancing the user's experience in obtaining details about a particular book.
